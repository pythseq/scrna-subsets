## Assess markers discovered after downsampling

This directory contains a script that computes marker genes for a varying sized Megakaryocyte cluster. The process is repeated 10 times. This analysis was run on a cluster using ~50 cores and took ~ 30 minutes.

The marker gene lists are included to avoid having to rerun this script.
